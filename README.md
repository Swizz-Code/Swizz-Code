Hi, 
You cann call me Swizz! ðŸ˜„
This is my first personal Github account.

I have a bachelors degree in eletrical engineering and information technology at the university in Stuttgart (Ã˜1.9).
Soon I figured out that I have a passion for coding, embedded systems and simply interesting software projects.


My main language is C/C++ but I am also interested in Python and JavaScript.

Let's see what amazing projects will emerge from here on âœ¨
